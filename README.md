# Personal Project Using Vanilla JavaScript.
The examples below are my personal projects using HTML5, CSS3 and JS. I also looked at some Traversy Media projects on twitter and decided to try to do or replicate the 50 Projects 50 Days of [Traversy Media Projects](https://50projects50days.com/), I do this on my own, because I have no way to pay a subscription to the course he directs.
